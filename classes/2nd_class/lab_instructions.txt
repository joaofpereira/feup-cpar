Lab work: computing PI

Download the zip file in the link below and:

1 - Change the program according to the solutions presented and measure their performance from n=10^5 to 10^9.

2. Why the precision of PI does not reduce consistently? (use a single thread)

3. Propose and implement a solution to increase precision.
