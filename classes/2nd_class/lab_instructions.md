    - 10⁵
        Number of divisions ? 100000
        PI = 3.14159265359812467

    - 10⁶
        Number of divisions ? 1000000
        PI = 3.14159265358987128

    - 10⁷
        Number of divisions ? 10000000
        PI = 3.14159265358980377

    - 10⁸
        Number of divisions ? 100000000
        PI = 3.14159265358981488

    - 10⁹
        Number of divisions ? 1000000000
        PI = 3.14159265358976825

2. Why the precision of PI does not reduce consistently? (use a single thread)

3. Propose and implement a solution to increase precision.
